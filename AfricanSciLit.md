- Translations of selected scholarly works / summaries into Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo
- From the translation of the Abstract the journalists can write a lay summary in English and/pr Yoruba
- auto translate via the GTranslate plugin on our website


Process 
- we contact the journalists and connect them to corresponding authors to ask them 
1) for approval of a translation of their work, 
2) let them counter read the translation for accuracy
3) add a few interview questions which we have compiled and could add as a profiling of the author research department, research topic, itâ€™s relevance for Africa in general etc.
